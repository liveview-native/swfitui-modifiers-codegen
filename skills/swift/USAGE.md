# Swift and SwiftUI Skill Usage

## When to Use

**Load this skill when writing any Swift or SwiftUI code.**

Automatically loaded when:
- Writing or refactoring Swift code (any domain)
- Implementing SwiftUI views and components
- Managing state and data flow
- Writing tests
- Documenting public APIs

## What It Provides

Modern Swift and SwiftUI best practices:
1. **Code Quality** - Naming, error handling, memory management, type safety
2. **SwiftUI Patterns** - View composition, state management, modifiers
3. **Performance** - Efficient updates, lazy loading, task management
4. **Testing** - Coverage requirements, async testing, TDD workflow
5. **Documentation** - Public API documentation (skip private code)

## Key Philosophy

- Safety first: optionals, type safety, error handling
- Declarative UI: describe what, not how
- Value types over reference types when possible
- Public APIs MUST be documented and tested
- Private/internal code MAY skip documentation
- Avoid retain cycles with [weak self] or [unowned self]
